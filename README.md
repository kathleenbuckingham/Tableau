The visualizations show that in the data, people born in 1969 and millennials, born between the early 1980s and early 1990s, are the most frequent users of Citi-bikes. Looking at the time of day of usage, millennials appear to use the bikes to commute to and from work. There are surges of use around 8am and 6pm. Other age groups do not appear to have such evident usage patterns.

The start and end use maps show that start of use tends to be more westerly and end use ends in the east of the city.
